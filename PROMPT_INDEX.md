# DJConnect Verification Prompt Index

Status: canonical prompt navigation

This index tells clean Codex and AI-agent sessions which verification prompt is
active, what came before it and which evidence proves status. Chat history is
not required.

## Active Next Phase

Phase 9L-R6 has qualified the local Home Assistant verification lab. Docker
Desktop access to macOS `Documents` restored repository bind mounts, the
canonical `ha-profile` lab started, lab-only HA auth was bootstrapped, REST and
WebSocket probes passed, and `PROFILE-001` through `PROFILE-005` executed
successfully through the Home Assistant adapter. The active next step is Phase
9V rerun: Verification Platform Qualification Rerun.

Use this clean-session prompt:

```text
Read BOOTSTRAP_CODEX_VERIFICATION.md and execute Phase 9V rerun from PROMPT_INDEX.md.
```

## Status Rules

- `Complete` means repository evidence exists and the work has been merged or
  committed as a completed artifact.
- `Not qualified` means the phase ran and produced a negative decision.
- `Remediated with external prerequisites` means blockers were converted into
  checks or explicit prerequisites, but the platform is not yet qualified.
- `Active next phase` means a clean session should execute that prompt.
- `Not qualified - external Docker prerequisite` means remediation code
  improved framework behavior, including lab-only HA auth bootstrap and modular
  lab composition, but live lab qualification is blocked by local Docker runtime
  prerequisites outside repository code.
- `Blocked` means do not start the phase until the predecessor result changes.
- `Not qualified` means the phase produced required artifacts but still has
  blocking prerequisites.

Do not mark Phase 9L complete until repository evidence includes its local lab
qualification report and the final result line.

Exact clean-session command for the active phase:

```text
Read BOOTSTRAP_CODEX_VERIFICATION.md and execute Phase 9V rerun from PROMPT_INDEX.md.
