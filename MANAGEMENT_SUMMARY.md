# DJConnect Generation 2 Management Summary

**Decisions:** `DJCONNECT_GENERATION_1_COMPLETED`,
`DJCONNECT_GENERATION_2_ESTABLISHED`,
`ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_ALIGNED`
**Basis:** Objective repository evidence recorded in the linked documents.

## Current position

| Area | Objectively supported status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform Engineering | Completed and frozen | `ARCHITECTURE_DECISION.md` |
| Verification Runtime | Operational and frozen at 1.1.0 | `PLATFORM_BASELINE_CERTIFICATION.md` |
| Software Assurance | Completed and frozen | `docs/software_assurance/SOFTWARE_ASSURANCE_GENERATION_1_CLOSURE_REPORT.md` |
| Trusted Delivery | Completed and frozen | `docs/software_assurance/TRUSTED_DELIVERY_CERTIFICATION.md` |
| Platform Release Engineering | Architecture qualified and frozen | `docs/release/PLATFORM_RELEASE_QUALIFICATION.md` |
| Platform Release 3.3 Internal | Operational, blocked | `docs/release/PLATFORM_RELEASE_MANAGEMENT_SUMMARY.md` |
| Engineering Workflow | Aligned; no implementation changed | `docs/meta/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_ALIGNMENT_COMPLETION.md` |

## Generation 2 decision

The evidence supports a transition from Generation 1 platform construction to
the three-program Generation 2 operating model: DJConnect Product Development,
Platform Evolution and Innovation Lab. Product Development is primary;
Platform Evolution supports it; Innovation Lab researches without owning
production delivery.

The Generation 1 historical closing record is
`ENGINEERING_PLATFORM_GENERATION_1_COMPLETION_REPORT.md`. Its remaining Release
3.3 work is operational and does not reopen Platform Engineering.

No implementation, release execution or Engineering Platform redesign was
performed for this strategy refresh.

## Engineering workflow alignment

The completed Engineering Governance increment defines one mandatory workflow for
future work: one prompt, one engineering increment and one reviewable pull
request. Merge remains an explicit governance decision. The resulting
evidence is recorded in `docs/meta/ENGINEERING_WORKFLOW_ALIGNMENT_COMPLETION.md`
and reviewable in PR [#107](https://github.com/pcvantol/djconnect/pull/107).

## Documentation outcome

`ROADMAP_INDEX.md` provides one navigation source. `PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`,
`PLATFORM_EVOLUTION_BACKLOG.md` and `INNOVATION_BACKLOG.md` are the only active
program registers. `PLATFORM_BACKLOG.md` remains a clearly marked Generation 1
archive. Promotion rules are explicit in `INNOVATION_PROMOTION_POLICY.md`.
